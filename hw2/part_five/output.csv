From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




(Redirected from 
Article 8
)




Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights
 provides a right to respect for one's ""
private
 and 
family life
, his home and his 
correspondence
"", subject to certain restrictions that are ""in accordance with law"" and ""
necessary in a democratic society
"". The 
European Convention on Human Rights
 (ECHR) (formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.





Right
[
edit
]


Article 8 – Right to respect for private and family life


1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.


2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.


Article 8 is considered to be one of the convention's most open-ended provisions.
[1]




Family life
[
edit
]


In 
X, Y, and Z v. UK
, the Court recalls that ""the notion of 'family life' in Article 8 is not confined solely to families based on marriage and may encompass other de facto relationships. When deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to 'family life', a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couples live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means.



Home
[
edit
]


In 
Niemietz v Germany
 case the court gave broader meaning to the 'home' notion including professional/business premises such as a lawyer's office.
[2]




Private life
[
edit
]


For better understanding of perception of ""
private life
"" case law should be analyzed. In 
Niemietz v. Germany
, the Court held that it ""does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an exhaustive definition of the notion of 'private life'. However, it would be too restrictive to limit the notion to an 'inner circle' in which the individual may live his own personal life as he choose and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. Respect for private life must also comprise
[3]
 to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationship and develop relationship with other human beings.""



Case law
[
edit
]


Article 8 clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for ""private and family life"" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the 
right to privacy
. Furthermore, Article 8 sometimes comprises 
positive obligations
: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus 
not
 to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to 
do
 something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced father to his child).



Golder v. United Kingdom
 (1975) 1 EHRR 524 – A prisoner requested a lawyer because he said he wanted to sue a guard for 
defamation
. Access was denied. This violated the 
right to a fair trial
 (
Article 6 ECHR
) and client confidentiality.
[4]


Silver v. United Kingdom
 (1981) 3 EHRR 475 – Censorship of a prisoner's correspondence regarding conditions in prison breached Article 8.


R v Brown
 [1994] 1 AC 212 – Article 8 was deemed not to ""[invalidate] a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind"" (specifically, 
assault occasioning actual bodily harm
 as part of consensual sadomasochistic sex acts) by the UK 
House of Lords
.
[5]


Rotaru v. Romania
 [2000] ECHR 192 – Public information that is systematically collected and stored in files held by a state or its agents falls within the scope of private life.
[6]


Pretty v. United Kingdom
 [2002] Article 8 extends to protect the right to die. Like with articles 9, 10 and 11, it can be interfered with provided there's valid justification, as there was in 
Pretty
.


Mosley v News Group Newspapers
 [2008] 
EWHC 1777 (QB)
 — Per Eady J, equitable breach of confidence is extended to protect Art. 8 rights.


S and Marper v United Kingdom
 [2008] ECHR 1581 – Retention of DNA information in respect of persons arrested but not convicted of an offence was held to breach Article 8.


A, B and C v Ireland
 [2010] ECHR 2032 – Article 8 does not confer a ""right to abortion"", but the Republic of Ireland breached it by making it difficult for a woman to establish whether she qualifies for a legal abortion.


Gillan and Quinton v United Kingdom
 [2010] ECHR 28 – Stop and search powers granted to police under ss. 44–47 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000
 were neither sufficiently circumscribed nor subject to adequate legal safeguards against abuse. As such, the Court found the powers not to be ""in accordance with the law"", in violation of Article 8.
[7]


Birmingham City Council v Clue
 (2010) EWCA Civ 460 29/4/2010 – A challenge to the decision to refuse to provide Ms Clue and her family with essential support pending the UK Border Agency's determination of her application for 
indefinite leave to remain
 in the UK. In a ground-breaking decision of the Court of Appeal, the judgment extends the scope of community care provision for families subject to immigration control who seek to remain in the UK on Article 8 ECHR grounds.


Plantagenet Alliance v Ministry of Justice and others
 (2014) EWHC 1662 – Article 8 did not entitle modern-day descendants of the 
House of Plantagenet
 to be consulted on the place of re-interment of 
Richard III
.


Zakharov v. Russia
 (2015) – The Court examined Russian surveillance legislation 
in abstracto
, finding unanimously that the existence of inadequate legislation and its application in practice themselves amounted to a violation of the applicant's rights under Article 8.
[8]


The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's Application
 [2015] NIQB 96 – 
Northern Ireland's criminalization of abortion
 in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest 
declared incompatible
 with Article 8
[9]


Aycaguer v. France
 (2017) -- ECHR found France's use of biological sampling for criminal DNA databases to be a violation of Article 8 in the case of Jean-Michel Aycaguer, a french national convicted of non-violent crime. Importantly, the court did not find the entire practice to be in violation, but claimed that the seriousness of Aycaguer's crimes did not constitute a situation wherein public interest outweighed his right to privacy in his private life.
[10]


The notion of private life in the Article 8 is also interpreted as including some duty of environmental protection.
[11]




Cases involving LGBT rights
[
edit
]


The following cases deal with the applicability of Article 8 to issues related to LGBT people including the recognition of 
same-sex marriage
, 
laws prohibiting sodomy
, and access to 
health services for transgender people
.



Modinos v. Cyprus
 (1993) – Ruling invalidating 
Section 171 of the Criminal Code of Cyprus
 under which male homosexual acts were banned, finding that there had been a breach under Article 8 of the applicant's right to respect for private life.


Smith and Grady v United Kingdom
 (1999) 29 EHRR 493 – The investigation into and subsequent discharge of personnel from the Royal Navy on the basis of sexual orientation was a breach of the right to a private life under Article 8.


Van Kück v. Germany
  [2003] ECHR 285 – Inadequate access to a fair hearing in a case involving reimbursement by a private medical insurer for costs of 
hormone replacement therapy
 and 
gender reassignment surgery
 by a transsexual woman, where undue burden had been placed upon her to prove the medical necessity of the treatment, was a violation under Article 8 and 
Article 6 § 1
.
[12]


Oliari and Others v Italy
 (2015) – Italy violated Article 8 by not providing legal recognition to same-sex couples.


R (Elan-Cane) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
 [2020] EWCA Civ 363 – UK courts held that issues of gender engaged Article 8 as gender was central to a person's private life.
[13]
[14]


Violation of the convention by mass surveillance
[
edit
]


Mass surveillance
, such as by the programs revealed in 
Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures
, is often accused of violating the 8th article of the European Convention on Human Rights.
